# SchoolBusTracker_WebServices


### Project Purpose ###
This project started as my Senior Design project in college. Unfortunately, in college I was not so in-tune with Software Development cycle/best practices. Now 2 years into the IT Corporate world I’m have now a better understanding. Thus this 2nd attempt at this project.

The Problem:
Daily we send kids to be picked up at the school bus stop, never knowing if the child ever made it to school safely. Sometimes by the time we are aware of any issues it might be too late.

Solution:
The purpose of this project is to create an Android Phone/Tablet app that with the support of a back end, keep track of children being picked up at a bus stop. With the table the driver, while stopped at the bus stop will be able to scan a barcode/Qr Code imprinted on a child’s school card/bracelet/tag. As a backup mechanism, the driver should be able to select the children from a list if the child does not have a barcode item. This solution should be quick to minimally disrupt the flow of onboarding children. The system should automatically send parents/school notifications regarding the status of the child.
